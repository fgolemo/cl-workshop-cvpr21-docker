        This forward pass can handle three different scenarios, depending on the
        contents of `observations.task_labels`:
        1.  Base case: task labels are present, and all examples are from the same task.
            - Perform the 'usual' forward pass (e.g. `super().forward(observations)`).
        2.  Task labels are present, and the batch contains a mix of samples from
            different tasks:
            - Create slices of the batch for each task, where all items in each
              'sub-batch' come from the same task.
            - Perform a forward pass for each task, by calling `forward` recursively
              with the sub-batch for each task as an argument (Case 1).
        3.  Task labels are *not* present. Perform some type of task inference, using
            the `task_inference_forward_pass` method. Check its docstring for more info.

        Parameters
        ----------
        observations : Observations
            Observations from an environment. As of right now, all Settings produce

        Returns
        -------
        Tensor
